# Events

**Event** is a signal that something has happened.
<br />
The **Event Handler** reacts on an event and runs a code.

## Event object
```Event()``` constructor creates a new Event. It can be <u>dispatched</u> and <u>listened</u> from and by any element.

```js
const foo = (e) => {      
  const evt = new Event('greeting')
  document.dispatchEvent(evt)
}

document.addEventListener('greeting', (e) => {
  document.querySelector('.text').innerHTML = 'Hello World!'
})
```

It accepts the *name of the event* and an optional *options* dictionary as arguments.

Option dictionary includes these boolean values:
* **bubbles** if ```true``` propagation starts from target element and bubbles up until it reaches the root node.  
* **cancelable** if ```true``` enables the listener to cancel and ```preventDefault()```.
* **composed**

```js
const container = document.querySelector('.container')
const prg = document.querySelector('.text')

const foo = (e) => {      
  const evt = new Event('greeting', { bubbles: true, cancelable: true })
  prg.dispatchEvent(evt)
}

container.addEventListener('greeting', (e) => {
  prg.innerHTML = 'Hello World!'
})  
```

In the example above, because ```bubbles``` is true for ```evt```, it can be listened by the containing element.
<br /> 
If false, ```container``` was not able to listed on an event dispatched by ```prg```.

<br />

### dispatchEvent()
Triggers the EventListener on the target element.

```js
const evt = new Event('greeting')

document.dispatchEvent(evt)
document.querySelector('.text').dispatchEvent(evt)
```

The return value of from a dispatch is always ```true```, except if the event is ```cancelable``` and the event handler calls ```preventDefault()``` on the event.

```js
const evt = new Event('greeting', { cancelable: true })
isCancelled = !document.dispatchEvent(evt) // true

document.addEventListener('greeting', (e) => {
  e.preventDefault()
})
```

<br />

### addEventListener()
It sets up a handler for an event on an element.
<br />
It receives a string representing the event type as first argument.
The second argument is the *listener* function that will fire when the event is dispatched.

```
addEventListener(type, listener, useCapture)
```

#### useCapture
Event capturing and bubbling are two methods of event propagation:

**Event Capturing**
is a type of event propagation that event starts from the root node (outer most) and reverse the DOM until it reaches the element that has raised the event.

**Event Bubbling**
propagation starts from target element (inner most) and bubbles up until it reaches the root node. This is the default behavior of ```addEventListener```.

```js
document.querySelector('.text').addEventListener('greeting', (e) => {
  console.log(e.target);
}, true)
```

In the code above, capturing has been selected. Therefore, if a *dispatch* for *greeting* has happened in an element inside ```.text```, it will be captured by ```.text``` listener first.

The event will *propagate* further in if this listener does not call ```e.stopPropagation()```.

## CustomEvent object
Is essentially almost the same as ```Event``` object, except that it can include more data with the ```detail``` property.

```js
const evt = new CustomEvent('greeting', {
  detail: {
    name: 'Alfie',
    salutation: 'Mr.'
  }
})

const foo = (e) => {
  document.dispatchEvent(evt)
}

document.addEventListener('greeting', (e) => {
  document.querySelector('.greeting').innerHTML = `Greeting ${e.detail.salutation} ${e.detail.name}`
})
```

<br />

## Event Methods

#### preventDefault()
Cancels the event if it's cancelable. Useful when we just want to get notified if an event has been raised, but we want to take a different action.

```js
<form>
  <label>Agree:</label>
  <input type="checkbox" class="chb" />
</form>

<script>
  document.querySelector('.chb').addEventListener('click', (e) => {
    e.preventDefault()    
  })  
</script>
```

The ```preventDefault``` in the example will prevent the checkbox from being checked.

<br />

#### stopPropagation() & stopImmediatePropagation()
These methods blocks an event from capturing or bubbling further more.

This is particularly helpful when place it on the target element event handler itself when we donâ€™t want any other eventListener to handle the event in the default bubble phase.

The difference between the two method is that ```stopPropagation()``` still allows other handlers to be executed on the element, but ```stopImmediatePropagation()``` stops all events from happening.
