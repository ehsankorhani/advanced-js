# Design patterns

> Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design.

### Categories of patterns

**Creational patterns** provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

**Structural patterns** explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient.

**Behavioral patterns** take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
