# Factory method

Is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects.

The pattern suggests that you replace direct object construction calls (using the ```new``` operator) with calls to a special factory method.

## Applicability

* When we donâ€™t know beforehand the exact types and dependencies of the objects and we want to defer that to run time.
* Can reduce code complexity in decision making matrixes.
